### AI Retrieval Augmented Generation Chatbot project using Lanchain APIs.

- Project Scope: This project is only meant for learning purposes in order to grasp Langchain APIs and how to use them in a real-world scenario. The project is a chatbot that uses AI to generate responses to user queries. The chatbot is trained on a dataset of conversations and is able to generate responses based on the context of the conversation. The chatbot is also able to retrieve information from the web using Langchain APIs and provide relevant information to the user.

- Future Work: Eventually, updates will be made in order for the chatbot to perform more complex queries and also updates in the frontend to make it more user-friendly.
